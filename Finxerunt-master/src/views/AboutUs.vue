          principle research-based campaigns, the organization takes on tough
          global issues along with thousands of students globally through active
          civic engagement. The organization's peer-reviewed intense research is
          done at our laboratory network where students and experts work
          side-by-side to collect data to come up with the much needed courses
          of actions to create a sustainable future. Then after, Finxerunt
          develops campaigns and policies, while working with politicians and
          representatives to bring change to public policy globally. At the same
          time, the grassroots aspects creating a diverse community comes
          together around educating people on these researched issues through
          film-making, journalism, and social media.
