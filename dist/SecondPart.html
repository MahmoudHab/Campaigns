                <h2>Round 2 of the Symposium (Policy Writing Marathon):</h2>

<p>For the second round of the International Socioeconomics Laboratory’s annual symposium, high school and undergraduate students will submit policies based on the research conducted in round 1. Participants will draft policy memos to be reviewed and finalized by the organization. Students are not required to win or participate in the first round to take part in the policy writing marathon. All policy will be developed based on students’ own research, and students are eligible for grants and scholarships through their work. This policy will be the basis of future proposed legislature, and will be based on original empirical findings.
<br>
<br>
A policy writing marathon is a competitive event, in which a "policy memo" is the expected deliverable. A policy memo will be created and submitted by each team and reviewed by experienced members of the board. All policy is collaborative and fluid, in order to develop the best and most professional policy possible. The goal of policy development is to create work that is lobbyible, tangible, effective and impactful. 
<br>
<br>
After the empirical studies are finished, students are given the opportunity to join the policython. There is no requirement to be a part of round 1 to participate in round 2. Students will read through the finished papers, and work in teams to develop policy. All research topics will be lobbyable and groups will collaborate to develop the most efficient and effective policy.
<br>
<br>
Participants receive the opportunity to network with fellow students interested in policy, hear from professionals in the field of public policy, law, and government, and will receive feedback on their final submissions. The Policythons are non-partisan, and will lead to real life change based on student research.
