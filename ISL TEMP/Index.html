<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><em>The International Socioeconomics Laboratory™  is a 
    global research laboratory made up of young adults that strive to find the most adequate solutions to current socio-economic problems. 
    We make use of existing records and data to create our own comprehensive models and studies to find plausible routes to the root cause 
    of these problems and see what can be done about them or what knowledge can be acquired. However, our information collection is not 
    limited to what is already in sight; though it may be more difficult given the unprecedented times, we also look to collect information
     and data through surveys and soon, experiments as well. The goal of the Laboratory is clear; assess and address the issues that face
      our society and create solutions to them, in order to foster a greater, better society.</em></span></span></p>
